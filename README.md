# PREDICT 
## *your personalized weather app tailored to provide the only weather data that is right for you*


## DESCRIPTION
- The App\
This weather app (Predict) was made to provide accurate weather data to users, for both real-time and forecast along with other 
features (to be implemented) that provides a cohesive user experience. A user is given a simple UI to navgiate between different parts and pages of the app to find the important info they need most without the hassle of finding it through all the clutter that most weather apps display either on the side, as overlays, or with different multi-faceted colors, schemes, and fonts. 

- Motivation\
As a personal anecdote, I've always felt a little frustrated with how weather apps, whether used on a mobile device or through a desktop site, had too much weather data the I never really needed to know. All I desired was for simple real-time data to be displayed alongside the chances of rain, snow, strong winds, and so forth easily listed. I decided that developing a personal, to match the user's preference, weather application could allow ease of use and less hassle for better experience of understanding what's going on outside. 

- Technologies\
Predict currently utilizes the React library to contribute to and maintain the overall UI and experience for the user. The Express framework is utilized with the Node runtime to create the communications between the Tomorrow.io API, the server, and the front-end.
